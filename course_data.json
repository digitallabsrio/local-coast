  "course_name": "GitOps—Modern Operations for Cloud Native Applications - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "GitOps is an operational model that allows developers to accelerate the delivery of cloud-native applications that run on Kubernetes.\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn the essential principles behind GitOps and how to apply the operational model to modern cloud-native systems. The course provides a detailed description of the relationship between GitOps and technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. You’ll gain hands-on experience managing containerized workloads that run on Kubernetes using Flux. Additionally, you’ll explore how GitOps is used to execute progressive delivery strategies with Flagger.\n\nAfter completing this course, you’ll be prepared to manage the operations of systems using GitOps. You’ll be able to establish and manage the GitOps operational model for systems that run on Kubernetes. You’ll also understand how to install and configure tools like Flux and Flagger that improve your systems' stability and rate of change.",
